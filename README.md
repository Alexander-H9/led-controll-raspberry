# led-controll-raspberry
Controll the connected led with your voice.
Start the shell script and give your command. Stop the script with "ctrl + c". The command "licht an" will turn on the led. In this case, the shell script will start the python script with your command as parameter. Python then controlls the led depending on your command. You need to create a API Key from Google. The commands and actions can easily be expanded.
